== Environment variables for configuration

Scaffolded apps are preconfigured to support these environment variables :

- *YESOD_STATIC_DIR*     : Path of static directory.
- *YESOD_HOST*           : Host/interface the server should bind to.
- *YESOD_PORT*           : Port to listen on.
- *YESOD_IP_FROM_HEADER* : Get the IP address from the header when logging. Useful when sitting behind a reverse proxy.

They are listed in file `/config/settings.yml`, where their default values can be defined.
Other variables can be added by uncommenting dedicated lines :

- *YESOD_APPROOT* : Explicit base for all generated URLs.
- *PORT*          : Port for Keter.
