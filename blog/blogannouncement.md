New Haskell/Yesod beginner Blog

This is the annoncement for a new Haskell Beginners Blog, which first series of articles will handle the building of two Yesod-projects: a personal Blog with slighly powered batteries and in addition examples of functionality from a small-buisiness-website.

As I have decided to learn Haskell late and not long ago, this Blogpost is written out of a straight programming beginners point of view, and like so will handle also prelimiaries annoying to people with a different background. At least I hope to transport in this Blog a naive and therefore somehow pure view on things.

I was honestly afraid to use Yesod as a first step in my learning Haskell journey - you all know it is a big, non trival framework - but somehow, after a while of proving and looking into it, I felt quite save and secure to not miss the point. I mean, moving around in it's structure felt somehow good and plausible. I hope to transport that in this Blog. 

Let me know...
